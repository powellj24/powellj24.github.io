      I am currently in my early medical school / pre-graduate school years at Stanford. I am doing a mix of
      wet lab and computational work with mice and humans. I primarily work with adult and pediatric epilepsy patients, 
      as well as patients with autism spectrum disorders.

      <br />I started rotating in the
      <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/index.html" target="_blank">DLab</a> in December of 2024. My rotation projects
      included both mouse work (primarily using Neuropixels to record from the brain of mice), and human 
      work (including human transcriptomics and memory). All of the human work I was able to 
      be involved in was through the Human Neural Circuitry (HNC) program led by Deisseroth. 
      <br />
      <br /> I really enjoyed the rotation, and felt like there were endless things to do in the lab, 
      so I joined right after in April 2025. My current work focuses on bridging mouse and human studies, 
      largely in the realm of social interaction and autism spectrum disorders.

      In the summer and autumn of 2024, I worked with
      <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/ashwin-ramayya" target="_blank">Dr. Ashwin Ramayya</a>, doing computational projects
      focusing on how the brain anticipates stimuli or, conversely, reacts to unexpected stimuli to encode prediction error.
      <br /><br />The RLab had just started then, and I was an attendee of the inaugural lab meeting. 
      It was great to see the lab grow over those months. I am fortunate enough to continue working with Dr. Ramayya through
      DLab collaborations.

      For most of undergrad at Penn I worked in the
      <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/song-lab/" target="_blank">Song Lab</a> advised by Dr. Yuanquan Song</a>. I primarily led
      projects focused on axon regeneration after injury, particularly in a <i>Drosophila</i> model where injury was induced
      via 2-photon laser ablation. The topics I focused on the most were how neuronal excitability and the biophysical interactions
      between neurons and glia could alter regeneration. 
      <br />
      <br /> Because of this focus on excitability, I also worked on a computational project with Dr. Yoichiro Mori attempting to 
      model the calcium dynamics in the growth cone of a regenerating neuron.
